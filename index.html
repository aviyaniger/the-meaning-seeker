        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2>The Viktor Frankl Institute of Logotherapy in Israel is an educational and training institute for personal
            and professional enrichment through the study of Logotherapy.</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Head trainer: Batya Yaniger, PsyD</li>
            <li>Trainers:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Avraham Friedman, LCSW</li>
                <li>Dida Kimor, PhD</li>
                <li>Tanchum Burton, LCSW</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>The therapeutic approach of Logotherapy (healing through finding meaning in life) was created by
            psychiatrist, neurologist philosopher and holocaust survivor Viktor Emile Frankl (1905-1997), world famous
            author of the best seller Man’s Search for Meaning.

            At the present time it is one of two Institutes that offers a 100% online training program worldwide.

            Courses take place in small groups, which affords maximum interactive discussion for absorption of the
            material as well as maximum individual attention in case supervvision.

            The courses are accredited by the International Association of Logotherapy and Existential Analysis at the
            Viktor Frankl Institute of Vienna, Austria. Successful graduates are eligible to be registered as
            Logotherapists and receive a certificate of Accreditation which may be used on official documents.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT LOGOTHERAPY -->
    <section id="aboutLogotherapy">
        <h1>About Logotherapy</h1>

        <p>Logotherapy is the healing approach created by Dr. Viktor Frankl (1905-1997), psychiatrist, neurologist,
            holocaust survivor and author of the bestseller <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Gift-Edition/dp/080701429X">Man’s Search for
                Meaning</a></p>

        <p>Logotherapy is based on three principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Freedom of Will: Human beings are not determined but self-determining</li>
            <li>Will to Meaning: Human beings are motivated by higher values</li>
            <li>Meaning of life: Life has meaning independent of our perception of it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Logotherapy is used effectively in the treatment of depression, addictions, illness and a wide variety of
            therapeutic issues, and it is particularly helpful for people who have lost their sense of meaning and
            purpose. Logos is the Greek word for ‘meaning’. Hence, Logotherapy is healing through meaning. It is not
            what happens to you in life that determines your quality of life; it is your attitude towards what happens
            that makes the difference.</p>

        <p>Perspective makes all the difference. Logotherapy changes the way you view yourself, it changes the way you
            view life and it changes the way you relate to people and things.</p>

        <p>How does Logotherapy change the way you view yourself?</p>

        <p>It helps you to see yourself from an outside perspective. This is helpful in two ways. First of all, when you
            are seeing yourself from an outside perspective, you can look dispassionately at what you are doing and
            decide, ‘Who do I want to be?’ And then you are not locked into your behavior. You can move and change and
            BE who you want to be.</p>

        <p>In addition, when your focus is on meaning and not on yourself, then you find a ‘why’ to live for, something
            that matters to you more than the anxiety that is driving your behavior. This provides a strong and powerful
            motivation to change your behavior for the sake of someone or something you care about.</p>

        <p>How does logotherapy change the way you view life?</p>

        <p>Everything is seen in a meaningful context. So for example, the context of a prisoner in a concentration camp
            giving away a piece of bread to someone who was starving to death, has a meaning in the context of what is
            happening that it would not have if someone was living a life of luxury gives someone a slice of bread.
            Someone who is in recovery from addiction who says ‘No thank you’ to a glass of fine wine has meaning in the
            context that it would not have for someone who was never addicted. In the first case it shows incredible
            selflessness. In the second case it shows incredible courage. Selflessness and courage are examples of what
            is important. You learn to focus on the important things.</p>

        <p>When you view life this way, problems become more than ‘something to solve.’ Problems and challenges are the
            raw material with which to make positive change. Someone reflecting on her or his problem says ‘I never saw
            it that way before.’ And then the same problem that loomed large before now turns into something that serves
            them.</p>

        <h6>How does logotherapy change how you relate to people and things?</h6>

        <p>You are always in a dialogue. You understand that you are here for a reason, that everything you do matters.
            Therefore you are responsible to someone or something. In fact, you are responsible before your image of who
            you really should be. Viewed this way, you are never a detached observer. You are an intrinsic part of the
            world and you have a unique and irreplaceable role to play in the big picture of things.</p>
